Hello, this is explanation about linux booting!

Jadi pada saat linux booting, terjadi 6 tahap proses diataranya:

1. BIOS execute MBR
   - User turn on system computer
   - The CPU powers up and reads address xFFFF0 from the ROM 
   - Performs some integrity checks
   - Searches, loads, and executes the boot loader program
   - Loads and execute boot sector form MBR
   - Load OS

2. MBR execute GRUB
   - It contains information about GRUB
   - after MBR is loaded into RAM, control it and executes the GRUB boot loader

3. GRUB execute Kernel
   - GRUB has the knowledge of the filesystem
   - GRUB loads the user-selected (or default) kernel into memory and passes control on to the kernel

4. Kernel execute Init
   - Kernel is always store on memory until computer is tern off
   - init was the 1st program to be executed by Linux Kernel, the PID is 1

5. Init execute Runlevel programs
   _ The first processes that init starts is a script /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit 
   - Init starting system processes as defined in the /etc/inittab file
   - Looks at the /etc/inittab file to decide the Linux run level
   - Init identifies the default initlevel from /etc/inittab and uses that to load all appropriate program
   - Execute ‘grep initdefault /etc/inittab’ on your system to identify the default run level

6. Runlevel programs are excute
   - Depending to default init level setting, the system will execute the programs
